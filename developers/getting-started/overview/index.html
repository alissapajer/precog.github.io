<p>Please visit the <a href="../../../about/contact-us/index.html">Signup Page</a> to sign
up for a cloud-hosted account. When you signup, you&apos;ll be given an <em>account ID</em>, 
an <em>API key</em>, and a <em>root path</em>. 

</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account ID</strong> - Your account ID is globally unique and identifies your Precog account in a way that is stable, even if you decide to change your email address or API keys later.</li>
<li><strong>API Key</strong> - Your API key allows you to interact with the Precog API. The API key can be thought of as a combination of a username and a password.</li>
<li><strong>Root Path</strong> - Your root path is where all of your data lives inside the Precog file system. Your root path is just equal to <em>/&apos;accountId</em>, where <em>&apos;accountID</em> is your account ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can always find this information on your <a href="../../../account/index.html">account page</a> after logging in.

</p>
<h2>Precog File System</h2>
<p>Precog uses the metaphor of a file system to help you organize and share data.
When you store data in Precog, you must choose a directory to store the
data in.

</p>
<p>You don&apos;t have to create directories manually. Directories are
created on-demand whenever you try to put data in a directory that doesn&apos;t
exist yet.

</p>
<p>Precog doesn&apos;t support the notion of &quot;databases&quot; or &quot;tables&quot; or &quot;collections&quot;.
Instead, you can use the file system to create however many levels of
organization make sense to you.

</p>
<p>The Precog file system forms the basis of the security model, because all
grants are tied to a specific path. So the decision of how to organize your 
data is not completely arbitrary (unless you have no intention of sharing 
access to your data).

</p>
<p>The file system and associated security model make Precog multi-tenant out of the box.

</p>
<p>Technically, Precog supports hierarchical multi-tenancy, which is the most
sophisticated kind of multi-tenancy available. Your customers can have
customers, who in turn can have customers, for any number of levels deep, each
with rigorously defined and enforced permissions.

</p>
<p>Some common use cases may help illustrate. An advertising company might
structure its data like this:

</p>
<pre><code>/companyname/customerID/campaignID/web/cpm
/companyname/customerID/campaignID/mobile/impressions
/companyname/customerID/campaignID/mobile/clicks    
etc.</code></pre>
<p>An e-commerce platform might structure its data like this:

</p>
<pre><code>/platformname/clientcompany/transactions
/platformname/clientcompany/checkouts
/platformname/clientcompany/products
etc.</code></pre>
<h3>Root Path</h3>
<p>When you create an account, you are assigned a unique root path. This root
path is the same as your account ID.

</p>
<p>You will need to use your root path whenever you try to read or write data
in Precog, because initially, you will only have permissions for data in 
that directory.

</p>
<h2>Precog Data Model</h2>
<p>Precog natively stores and analyzes <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> data (actually, a superset of JSON data, but that&apos;s a detail you can ignore when getting started).

</p>
<p>You can store any JSON value inside the Precog file system, as well as append JSON values to existing resources.

</p>
<p>A JSON object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. For example:

</p>
<pre><code>{ "age:" 36,"customerID": "0019327","status": "active" }    </code></pre>
<p>Note that it is important that numeric values not be surrounded by quotes or
they will be interpreted as strings and not as numeric values.

</p>
<p>When possible, you should try to store your data as JSON objects, so that all data is labeled. 

</p>
<p>For example:

</p>
<pre><code>{"age": 19}        </code></pre>
<p>is better style than:

</p>
<pre><code>19</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, storing an array in a JSON object with a field name like below:

</p>
<pre><code>{"states": ["colorado","idaho","california"] }    </code></pre>
<p>is better than storing just the raw array:

</p>
<pre><code>["colorado","idaho","california"]</code></pre>
<p>However, Precog imposes no restrictions on the type of data you can store, and different values may have completely different schemas.

</p>
<h2>Data Ownership</h2>
<p>Your API key is tied to your Precog account. Any data you write to your root
path is automatically <em>owned</em> by your Precog account. This means no one can
see it unless you give them permission to see it.

</p>
<p>Precog is secure by default.

</p>
<p>Data ownership is tracked exhaustively in Precog so that no one can see
data unless the owner of the data has given them permission to see it.

</p>
<h2>Grants</h2>
<p>Precog manages permissions with the concept of <em>grants</em>. Grants confer some specific capability to the holder. Grants may be added to existing API keys.

</p>
<p>Precog currently supports the following kinds of grants:

</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read</strong> - This grant lets you read any data in a path that is owned by a set of accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong> - This grant lets you insert new data in a path that will be owned by one of a set of accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> - This grant lets you delete any data in a path that is owned by a set of accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you signup for a Precog account, you are given the ability to read any data that you own
(across the entire Precog file system, not just your root directory);
the ability to write data owned by anyone (but only inside your root directory), and the 
ability to delete data owned by anyone (only inside your root directory).

</p>
<p>If you have a grant, you can use that grant to create another grant which is
either less powerful than the original grant, or just as powerful as the
original grant.

</p>
<p>For example, if you have a read grant to a path called <em>/foo/</em>, then you can use
that read grant to create another read grant for <em>/foo/bar/</em> (which is strictly
less powerful than the original grant). Or if you have a write grant for <em>/foo/</em>
that does not expire, you could use that write grant to create another write
grant for <em>/foo/</em> that expires in two days.

</p>
<p>If you use a first grant to create a second grant, then you can revoke the second 
grant at any time. Additionally, if your grant is revoked, then all derived grants 
are revoked automatically.</p>
