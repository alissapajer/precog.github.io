<p>If you&apos;re interested in doing machine learning or predictive analytics with Precog, but aren&apos;t sure where to get started, this How To guide is for you.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" title="Machine learning">Machine learning</a> is the practice of using algorithms to understand and learn from data. Often, once an algorithm has been trained on initial data, it is then used to predict results for future data. One feature that sets Precog apart from many embedded reporting solutions is exactly this ability to to perform machine learning and predictive analytics.  Among other things, predictions can be used to create personalizations, recommendations or other sales optimizations.

</p>
<p>In this How To guide, we will cover simple introductory examples of clustering, linear regression and logistic regression. The guide will finish with a section on evaluation metrics because it is essential to have some idea of how useful a prediction is to you.  The code snippets included will use data included in the demo version of <a href="http://labcoat.precog.com/" title="Labcoat">Labcoat</a> so that you can run the queries and modify if desired.

</p>
<h3>Clustering</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis" title="Cluster analysis">Cluster analysis</a> is the process of finding groups in a set of data that are similar to each other.  The notion of similarity can vary depending on the specific clustering algorithm used, but the general idea is to find points in the data that minimize the distance between those points and the rest of the points in the data.  For more details, see an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medians_clustering" title="overview">overview</a> or the details on the <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/papers/03/kcoreset/kcoreset.pdf" title="specific algorithm we use">specific algorithm we use</a>.

</p>
<p>Suppose we had some demographic data and wanted to do customer segmentation.  The first step is to decide what charcteristic or characteristics we want to segment on.  To keep things simple, we&apos;ll choose to just do clustering on age for the example below.  It is worth noting that if you cluster on multiple dimensions, you will want to scale your data to get the best results. This first query creates a model with 7 age clusters. This is as simple as choosing some subset of data to be the input and selecting the number of clusters desired.  Choosing the number of clusters is a non-trivial and often ambiguos problem. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determining_the_number_of_clusters_in_a_data_set" title="overview">overview</a> of methods for choosing is availible. The resulting model will contain centroids that minimize the distance between each datapoint and its closest centroid. 

</p>
<pre><code>import std::stats::*
conversions := <span class="comment">//conversions</span>

input := { age : conversions.customer.age }
model := kMedians( input, <span class="number">7</span> )
model</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://labcoat.precog.com/?q=import+std::stats::*%0Aconversions+:=+//conversions%0A%09%0Ainput+:=+%7B+age+:+conversions.customer.age+%7D%0Amodel+:=+kMedians(+input,+7+)%0Amodel&apiKey=5CDA81E8-9817-438A-A340-F34E578E86F8&analyticsService=https://labcoat.precog.com/" title="Run in Labcoat">Run in Labcoat</a>

</p>
<p>For exploratory purposes, knowing these cluster centers might useful. We might be artificially trying to think about age demographics in convenient segments such as 21-25 or 30-39, but a natural segmentation from clustering might reveal that it makes more sense to consider 19-27 on cohort but provide finer grained distinctions of 31-33, 34-35 and 36-39.  But even more useful than simply knowing these centroids is to apply the model to existing data and do analytics on this augmented data.  In the example below, we are examining how much money is spent by customers in these various age clusters on average. This is done by using the base of the query above (which could be saved as its own cached query for convenient re-use) and augmenting the conversions dataset with a new cluster field.  We then do a solve statement where the implicit constraint comes from the where clause and allows the tic variable to take values from conversions&apos;.cluster.model1.clusterId.  Since determined the number of clusters, we know then, that the body of the solve will be computed 7 times, one for each value of clusterId. 

</p>
<pre><code>import std::stats::*
conversions := <span class="comment">//conversions</span>

</p>
<p>While many of the clusters have similar mean sales in this example there is still a significant discrepancy between the cluster with the highest mean sales being over 22% higher than the cluster with the lowest mean sales. Depending upon the demographics and cost of acquiring customers in the various clusters, this could be a meaningful insight that boosts average sales and revenue. 

</p>
<p>Some other uses for clustering include, but are certainly not limited to:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Spatial Data</li>
<li>Image Recognition</li>
<li>Recommendation Engine</li>
<li>Bio-informatics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linear Regression</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression" title="Linear regression">Linear regression</a> is a statistical technique for modeling the best fit line through a set of data points.  Given its name of linear, it should be clear that linear regression can have difficulty predicting relationships that are non-linear, but linear regression is still the best linear unbiased estimator of non-linear relationships. Linear regression is useful in an explanatory role to understand the relationship between variables and it is also useful to predict unknown values based on known variables. Predicting unknown values can be used for a variety of purposes:

</p>
<ul>
<li>imputing missing data (may yield better results than simply imputing the mean or median)</li>
<li>projecting trends based on underlying assumptions to create hypothetical scenarios</li>
<li>personalizing a user experience </li>
</ul>
<p>A regression equation is of the form:

</p>
<p>y = x0 + ẞ<sub>1</sub>x1 + ẞ<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + ... 

</p>
<p>where y is the dependent variable being predicted, x<sub>0</sub> is a constant y-intercept, x<sub>1</sub> through x<sub>n</sub> are dependent variables and ẞ<sub>1</sub> through ẞ<sub>n</sub> are the coefficients.  The interpretation of a regression is that for each 1 unit increase in x<sub>1</sub> there will on average be associated a ẞ<sub>1</sub> change in y.  

</p>
<p>A common example from economics is to look at the relationship between years of education and annual income.  In this example, years of education will be an independent variable and we are attempting to determine its relationship to annual income which will be the dependent variable :

</p>
<p>annual income in dollars = some constant + ẞ<sub>1</sub> * years of education + .... 

</p>
<p>The ... is important here.  These represent control variables that attempt to narrow the comparison as much as possible.  In this example, they might be things like race, gender, region and industry.  This helps isolate specifically the relationship that years of education has with annual income. Suppose that ẞ<sub>1</sub> is 3,000.  Then, on average, a 1 year increase in years of education is associated with a $3,000 increase in annual earnings.

</p>
<p>Part of what is so nice about linear regression is that it has such a clean and useful explanatory capability.  For raw predictive power, random forest will typically outperform linear regression, but linear regression still has a place in understanding specific relationships and their magnitude.  

</p>
<p>Here the starting point is determining what variable we are interested in predicting and what variables we think may be related to that variable. In the example below, we examine the relationship between an athlete’s weight and their height, age and medals won at the summer games in london. Weight is the dependent variable (y) and height, age and medals won are the independent variables (x<sub>1</sub> ... x<sub>n</sub> ). Similar to clustering, we create an object that contains our selected indepent variables and pass that object as the second argument of the linearRegression function.  We could declare the object directly in the function, but this method is generally cleaner to work with. 

</p>
<pre><code>medals := <span class="comment">//summer_games/london_medals</span>

indVars :=
{
HeightIncm : medals.HeightIncm,
Age : medals.Age,
Total : medals.Total
}

std::stats::linearRegression(medals.Weight, indVars)</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://labcoat.precog.com/?q=medals+:=+//summer_games/london_medals%0A%0AindVars+:=%0A%7B%0AHeightIncm+:+medals.HeightIncm,%0AAge+:+medals.Age,%0ATotal+:+medals.Total%0A%7D%0A%0Astd::stats::linearRegression(medals.Weight,+indVars)&apiKey=5CDA81E8-9817-438A-A340-F34E578E86F8&analyticsService=https://labcoat.precog.com/" title="Run this query in Labcoat.">Run in Labcoat</a>

</p>
<p>And a look at a subset of the output:

</p>
<pre><code>"model2": {
     "coefficients": [
       {
         "HeightIncm": {
           "estimate": 1.0997392523919332,
           "standardError": 0.031407749767906355
         },
         "Total": {
           "standardError": 0.7136294756726215,
           "estimate": 1.5812939398407877
         },
         "Age": {
           "estimate": 0.11920578883597059,
           "standardError": 0.06478117116040236
         }
       },
       {
         "estimate": -125.49027015629706,
         "standardError": 5.802076482230592
       }
     ],
     "residualStandardError": {
       "estimate": 10.505454174431426,
       "degreesOfFreedom": 905
     },
     "RSquared": 0.5814684929851268
   }</code></pre>
<p>Some things to notice above, starting from the bottom.  The RSquared value is a measure of percentage of variance explained by the regression.  Evaluating a RSquared value is typically quite domain dependent but gives some initial indication as to the explanatory power of the model.  Next, looking at the independent variables of height, age and medals we notice the estimate which is the coefficient and a standard error.  The ratio of the estimate to the standard error helps indicate what is statistically significant (a ratio of 2 or higher is generally meaningful). Both age and total are borderline, while height (unsurprisingly) is quite significant.  Each additional centimeter of height is on average associated with an additional kilogram of weight.  Notice also the high negative value of the y-intercept that this has to overcome.

</p>
<p>The above example covers the use of linear regression for deep exploratory analysis.  In the evaluation metrics section of this How To guide, we will cover how to use a model to predict unknown values. 

</p>
<h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression" title="Logistic Regression">Logistic regression</a> is regression designed for classification as opposed to predicting a continuous value.  It is appropriate when the dependent variable is categorical. An example of a categorical variable would be a set of colors.  If &quot;green&quot; is coded as 4 in our data and &quot;blue&quot; is coded as &quot;2&quot; it does not mean that we would expect to see twice the effect from a &quot;green&quot; than from a &quot;blue&quot;.  Our current implementation of logistic regression is limited to the binary case of predicting 1s and 0s. To classify a multinomial categorical variable, you can use random forest.

</p>
<p>We might also be interested in attempting to predict demographic data from other data we have access to (an example of imputing missing data).  These predictions might be fuzzy in their accuracy, but imputed values may still provide additional opportunities to make custom recommendations or sales optimizations.  For example, there may be recommendations that can be made based on gender.  So we can create a model that will predict gender based on the price of the product purchased and the age of the customer. This query works in exactly the same way as the linear regression query, in that it declares an object to be used as indepenent variables and uses that in conjunction with the depenent variables in the logisticRegression function.  One additional step is included, which is converting a text field to a binary numeric value.  This is accomplished using <em>if then else</em> syntax.  The <em>if</em> is followed by a boolean.  If the boolean is true, then the value after then is used, otherwise the value after else is included.  An <em>else</em> must be included. 

</p>
<pre><code>import std::stats::*

conversions := <span class="comment">//conversions</span>
conversions<span class="string">' := conversions with {female : 
                if conversions.customer.gender = "female" then 1 else 0 }

indVars :=
 {
 price : conversions'</span>.product.price,
 age : conversions<span class="string">'.customer.age
 }

logisticRegression( conversions'</span>.female, indVars)</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://labcoat.precog.com/?q=import+std::stats::*%0Aconversions+:=+//conversions%0Aconversions'+:=+conversions+with+%7Bfemale+:+if+conversions.customer.gender+=+%22female%22+then+1+else+0+%7D%0A%0AindVars+:=%0A+%7B%0A+price+:+conversions'.product.price,%0A+age+:+conversions'.customer.age%0A+%7D%0A%0AlogisticRegression(+conversions'.female,+indVars)&apiKey=5CDA81E8-9817-438A-A340-F34E578E86F8&analyticsService=https://labcoat.precog.com/" title="View in Labcoat.">Run in Labcoat</a>

</p>
<p>The resulting model will give us a probability estimate based on the price of the product being considered and the age of the customer that the customer is female. This can then be used to impute missing values in historical data or as a real-time prediction to generate dynamic content in an application.  

</p>
<p>Logistic regression can be helpful in many situations involving dichotomous variables:

</p>
<ul>
<li>health outcomes</li>
<li>fradulent behavior</li>
<li>conversions (vs not converting)</li>
<li>thresholds (above / below)</li>
<li>failure vs success</li>
</ul>
<h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
<p>It is often helpful to have some means of evaluating the quality of a prediction.  There are a multitude of such evaluation metrics and deciding on the correct one is an important part of the process (which is beyond the scope of this How To guide).  For a list of a number of metrics and their implementations in number of languages, see <a href="https://github.com/benhamner/Metrics" title="Ben Hamner’s repository">Ben Hamner’s repository</a> of metrics used in <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/" title="Kaggle competitions">Kaggle competitions</a>.

</p>
<p>Let’s focus on creating and deploying a single evaluation metric in Quirrel.  We’ll use root mean squared error (RMSE) because its relatively common.

</p>
<p>RMSE = sqrt(mean(observed - predicted)^2)

</p>
<p>In Quirrel, we can create a user-defined function that will calcluate the RMSE:

</p>
<pre><code>rmse(observed, predicted) :=

 diff := observed - predicted

 std::math::sqrt((mean(diff^2)))</code></pre>
<p>Now we just need some observed and predicted values to feed into our function. Let’s return to the olympics data, split it into a training and test set and use our model to predict the weight of athletes in the test set. The observe function take a data set and the std::random::uniform function (which takes a numeric as a seed).  It assigns a random number between 0 and 1 (0 inclusive, 1 exclusive).  We then use this random variable to split the data set with <em>where</em> filters. The main new feature of this query is the use of predictLinear which takes the data to predict on as the first argument and a model created with linearRegression as the second argument. 

</p>
<pre><code>medals := <span class="comment">//summer_games/london_medals</span>

filter := observe(medals, std::random::uniform(<span class="number">38</span>))
train := medals where filter &lt;= <span class="number">0.8</span>
test := medals where filter > <span class="number">0.8</span>

indVars :=
{
HeightIncm : train.HeightIncm,
Age : train.Age,
Total : train.Total
}

model := std::stats::linearRegression(train.Weight, indVars)
prediction := std::stats::predictLinear(test, model)

results := test with {prediction : prediction}

rmse(predicted, observed) :=
 diff := observed - predicted
 std::math::sqrt((mean(diff^<span class="number">2</span>)))

{
model1rmse : rmse(results.prediction.model1.fit, results.Weight),
model2rmse : rmse(results.prediction.model2.fit, results.Weight)
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://labcoat.precog.com/?q=medals+:=+//summer_games/london_medals%0A%0Afilter+:=+observe(medals,+std::random::uniform(38))%0Atrain+:=+medals+where+filter+%3C=+0.8%0Atest+:=+medals+where+filter+%3E+0.8%0A%0AindVars+:=%0A%7B%0AHeightIncm+:+train.HeightIncm,%0AAge+:+train.Age,%0ATotal+:+train.Total%0A%7D%0A%0Amodel+:=+std::stats::linearRegression(train.Weight,+indVars)%0Aprediction+:=+std::stats::predictLinear(test,+model)%0Aresults+:=+test+with+%7Bprediction+:+prediction%7D%0A%0Armse(predicted,+observed)+:=%0A+diff+:=+observed+-+predicted%0A+std::math::sqrt((mean(diff%5E2)))%0A%0A%7B%0Amodel1rmse+:+rmse(results.prediction.model1.fit,+results.Weight),%0Amodel2rmse+:+rmse(results.prediction.model2.fit,+results.Weight)%0A%7D&apiKey=5CDA81E8-9817-438A-A340-F34E578E86F8&analyticsService=https://labcoat.precog.com/" title="See the results in Labcoat">Run in Labcoat</a>

</p>
<p>Note that the results include rmse for two different models.  This is because Precog supports heterogeneous data.  So linear regression will create a model for each schema in the data.  Some observations are missing data for height, which dramatically reduces the quality of the prediction.  Notice that the RMSE for the model with height is almost twice as good as the model without.  This can help you understand your data better and the value that each component provides.

</p>
<p>These examples just scratch the surface of the ability to use Precog to leverage your data to create meaningful, revenue enhancing predictions in your application.  But they show how Precog is different from many traditional BI platforms and is focused on data science for deep, useful analysis.  </p>
