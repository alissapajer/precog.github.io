          <page class="post"></page>
          <section class="content"><p>Today marks the official launch of <strong>Precog in public beta</strong>! This means anyone (including you!) can <a href="https://www.precog.com/blog/Precog-Public-Beta-Unleashed-at-DataWeek/registration">sign up</a> for a free account on our <a href="../../index.html">website</a> and begin using our full stack of technology.</p>
<p>Approximately seven months ago, we unveiled Precog in private beta at the Strata Conference in Santa Clara, California. Since then, this next-generation of technology we originally developed during TechStars 2011 has only been accessible to a handful of select companies. Today, after more than two years in continuous development, we&apos;re opening the floodgates.</p>
<p>Precog represents a radical break with traditional data warehousing and analysis solutions. It&apos;s a disruptive solution that takes a fresh look at what modern data-driven companies need to effectively leverage their data assets. Historically, companies have paid a heavy price because data warehousing and data analysis are completely separate worlds, with different technologies, tools, and skill sets. Data warehousing solutions are adept at storing large amounts of data, and because they have programmatic interfaces, developers can integrate them into workflows and applications.</p>
<p>However, most data warehouses are only capable of storing data and doing simple aggregations. If you want to do something advanced with your data, you need to perform a complicated and costly Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process into a more capable data analysis tool, such as R, which requires an entirely different skill set.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.precog.com/?attachment_id=41" rel="attachment wp-att-41"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41" alt="hadoop" src="http://blog.precog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hadoop.jpeg" width="400" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Traditional data analysis tools like R and Matlab can only handle small amounts of data, and because they&apos;re designed for interactive use, it&apos;s not easy to integrate them into workflows and applications (though many have tried).</p>
<p>However, if you want to analyze real-world data (often gigabytes or terabytes in size), you have to radically downsample the data, which greatly decreases quality. After downsampling, a data scientist can aggregate, analyze, and model the data set. But if you want to deploy any of this work in production, you often have to completely recode it in a real programming language like Java, which is complicated, time-consuming, and very costly.</p>
<p>Why can&apos;t you perform sophisticated data science directly inside your data warehouse? Why can&apos;t a developer deploy the work of a data scientist, without needing to recode it in a programming language like Java? Why can&apos;t people use the same technology for doing both simple and advanced analytics across both small and big data sets?</p>
<p>Here at Precog, we are making all these things possible for the first time ever, with some <strong>truly groundbreaking technology</strong> we&apos;ve been furiously hard at work creating.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.precog.com/blog/Precog-Public-Beta-Unleashed-at-DataWeek/products/precog">Precog</a> combines the scalability of big data platforms with the number crunching power of statistical tools. It seamlessly and elegantly blends the world of the data scientist with the world of the software engineer, allowing the two to work together and use the same technology to solve their respective problems.</p>
<p>A data scientist can aggregate, massage, analyze, and model large amounts of data without needing a separate ETL process into a small-data statistical tool. Statistical models, aggregations, or complicated analytical calculations developed by a data scientist can be transparently run in production by software engineers, allowing new features to be added to products or allowing automation of workflows.</p>
<p>In addition to bridging the worlds of data science and big data engineering, Precog is groundup technology, unencumbered by legacy constraints. Precog comes packed with features that are critical in the modern world of big data, SaaS, and cloud computing &#8212; features that legacy systems either don&apos;t support at all, or don&apos;t support very well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-structured data.</strong> Precog stores JSON, which allows it to store everything from raw numbers and strings, to key-value pairs, to relational data, to tree data.</li>
<li><strong>Secure APIs.</strong> Analytics often need to be generated and consumed from web and mobile applications. Precog comes built-in with secure APIs that save developers the headache of creating, securing, and maintaining their own proprietary APIs and client libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-tenancy.</strong> Precog is multi-tenant out of the box, designed for deployment in complex environments which require fine-grained permissions and resource metering. Precog is useful out-of-the-box to software engineers, because of the rich APIs and client libraries that make it easy for developers to build data-driven features and automate workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data scientists will want to use our analysis tool called <a href="https://www.precog.com/blog/Precog-Public-Beta-Unleashed-at-DataWeek/products/labcoat">Labcoat</a>, built on top the Precog APIs. Labcoat packages much of the power of Precog into a user-friendly graphical tool that runs on all modern browsers.</p>
<p>In addition to the core Precog platform and our Labcoat tool, we also offer a next-generation visualization engine called ReportGrid. <a href="https://www.precog.com/blog/Precog-Public-Beta-Unleashed-at-DataWeek/products/reportgrid">ReportGrid</a> allows developers and end-users to build beautiful charts and reports over any data stored in Precog.</p>
<p>Together, Precog, Labcoat, and ReportGrid present a unified solution to common problems in big data engineering, data science, and business intelligence. This is beautifully pictured by the following illustration:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.precog.com/?attachment_id=42" rel="attachment wp-att-42"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42" alt="precog" src="http://blog.precog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/precog.jpeg" width="400" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Our customers are building all kinds of really interesting features into their apps using Precog technology. Some of them use Precog to build analytics and reporting into their applications (for their customers). Others use Precog to power recommendation engines and prediction systems. All of them rave about how much time and money they&apos;ve saved using Precog. Sound interesting? Then why not <a href="../../index.html">explore Precog</a> for yourself!</p>
<p>We&apos;ve made signup super easy &#8212; just go <a href="https://www.precog.com/blog/Precog-Public-Beta-Unleashed-at-DataWeek/registration">here</a> and fill out a simple form to get a free account on the Precog platform. From there, you can immediately begin using the Precog API, launch Labcoat and begin doing data analysis, or use ReportGrid to build a killer reporting dashboard.</p>
<p>With the launch of the public beta, we have more documentation than ever before, including API documentation, tutorials, and screencasts. Be sure to check out our documentation center for developers (which contains the all-important getting started guide), as well as our separate documentation area for the Labcoat product.</p>
<p>After you&apos;ve had a chance to play around, consider upgrading to one of our paid accounts, or just <a href="https://www.precog.com/blog/Precog-Public-Beta-Unleashed-at-DataWeek/contact">give us feedback</a> on how we can make our data analysis stack even better. We look forward to hearing from you!</p></section>
